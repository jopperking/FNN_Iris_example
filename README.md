Hi! I'm Jopperking a noober in coding :)! I LOVE  Deep Learning and AI!
 


# FNN Iris example

Classification with fully connected neural network with the IRIS dataset


## About
The structural data set of the findings includes 4 characteristics for the length and width of the sepals and petals, based on which the type of flower is distinguished from 3 different classes.


## Installing
You can use notebook with any installation by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jopperking/FNN_Iris_example/blob/master/iris_FNN.ipynb).
In fact, every page of this documentation is also available as an interactive notebook - click "Open in colab" at the top of any page to open it (be sure to change the Colab runtime to "GPU" to have it run fast!)
